        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Yam is a popular carbohydrate food in Ghana. It is mainly enjoyed by the Gas, Ewes and other major ethnic groups in Ghana.
            It can be pounded and enjoyed with soup as well as with stew or gravy. It can also be made into sophisticated intercontinental 
            meals such as yam balls. It is very easy to prepare.
